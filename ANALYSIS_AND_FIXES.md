# Budget Flow App - Analysis and Fixes

## Original Issues Found

The zip file `budget-flow-testing-backup.zip` contained a React Native budget tracking app with several configuration issues that needed to be resolved.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Package Name Mismatch
- **Issue**: `package.json` had name "event-plan-app" but `app.json` indicated this is a "BudgetFlow" app
- **Fix**: Changed package name from "event-plan-app" to "budget-flow" in `package.json`

### 2. ✅ Circular Dependency
- **Issue**: `package.json` contained a circular dependency: `"event-plan-app": "file:"`
- **Fix**: Removed the circular dependency line completely

### 3. ✅ Firebase Configuration Mismatch
- **Issue**: Firebase config referenced "event-app-91310" project but this is a budget app
- **Fix**: Updated Firebase configuration with placeholder values for a budget app project
- **Note**: User needs to replace placeholders with actual Firebase project credentials

### 4. ✅ Tab Navigation Issue
- **Issue**: Tabs layout referenced "all-expenses" tab that didn't exist as a tab file
- **Fix**: Removed the non-existent "all-expenses" tab from the tabs layout

### 5. ✅ Asset Files
- **Status**: All required asset files (icon.png, splash-icon.png, adaptive-icon.png, favicon.png) are present

### 6. ✅ App Structure
- **Status**: App routing structure is correct with proper expo-router setup
- **Status**: Import paths are correct for the file structure

## Project Structure

The app is a React Native Expo app using:
- **Framework**: Expo with expo-router for navigation
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **UI**: Custom themed components with dark/light mode support
- **Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with stack navigation for screens

## Key Features

- Budget tracking with categories
- Expense management

- Firebase integration for data persistence

## Next Steps

1. **Firebase Setup**: Replace placeholder values in `firebase/config.js` with actual Firebase project credentials
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the project directory
3. **Test the App**: Run `expo start` to test the application
4. **Environment Setup**: Ensure Expo CLI is installed and configured

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - Fixed name and removed circular dependency
- `firebase/config.js` - Updated with placeholder Firebase config
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.js` - Removed non-existent tab reference
